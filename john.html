      <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who&nbsp;Jesus is: A study Gospel of John</span></p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">John had something he wanted to say
as he sat to write his telling of the Jesus story. He wanted to make a
point. He wanted to make it clear. It was the one point but expressed
as two: Jesus was the word made flesh and he was the light of the
world. He wanted to say that Jesus wasn't defined as - a carpenter's
son who came from Galilee. Rather, he was the Son of God who came from
the throne-room. He came into the world not as a good teacher, prophet
or a good man, but as God. As CS Lewis put it - John leaves us with 2
choices concerning Jesus either you accept his claims that he is God or
you must see him as a mad man. For Jesus' claim that he is God is more
a lunacy than if he had claimed he was 'a poached egg'. John leaves us
with Jesus as the object of our worship or as a mad man to be
crucified. There is no middle ground with John. John is the
uncompromising mountainy man, a prophet, an eagle who soars into the
very throne-room of heaven to sees things that others have never seen.
He knows Jesus with stars in His hands and a sword in his mouth and a
face that shines like many suns and with a voice like sound of many
waters. </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">He is the one who was most intimate with Jesus as they travelled together to Jerusalem and the final crucifixion. </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">Jesus was killed because of his
claim that he came from the Father and was going back to him; he was
killed because he claimed he was one with the Father; he was killed
because he claimed to be the eternal Word of God and the Light of the
glory of the Father entered into this world. He was killed because he
was the Lamb of God who gave up his life for
us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">John wrote his Gospel to tell us
that all of this was and is true. Jesus is the Word of God and the
Light of the Glory of the Father. </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">Why was this so important to John?
The answer is made up of many parts. But above all, the one resounding
reason why John was so driven on this point is because of the seminal
moment he experienced on Mount Tabor. The mountain of
transfiguration.&nbsp; </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">John was on the Mountain with Peter,
James and Jesus when they met with Moses and Elijah. John was greatly
impacted by the vision of the transfiguration. He saw the light of the
glory in Jesus and heard the words of the Father telling him to listen
to the words of Jesus. It would be these 2 realities that both Peter
and John would carry with them for the rest of their lives: the word
and the light. </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">John starts his telling of the Jesus
story (Gospel) by introducing us to Jesus as the Word and as the Light.
John wants us to see Jesus as the Word and the Light and with this,
constantly in mind, he develops his gospel.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">As I have already said, John makes
his claim for Jesus clear at the start of his Jesus story. Building
from this foundational claim for Jesus he then quickly presents Jesus'
mission as the fulfilment of all of God's purposes. This has to be the
case, if the enormity of John&rsquo;s claims for Jesus are true: Jesus
must be seen to embrace all. There can be no aspect of God's dealing
with us which remains outside its compass. The light of glory places
the now older testament in the shade. The Jewish festivals, the
Sabbath, and all the 'this-worldly-thinking' are made subject to Jesus.
And in being brought into the Light of the Word these shadow signs
pointing to the light that now has come can't content with the reality
they pointed to. Reality is more than the signs that point to that
reality. Like the signposts that point to a beach they are not the
place to take out your bucket and spade and start to build sandcastles.
And once you have gone onto the beach you will never again stop at the
signs, no matter how attractive they are made, you will follow their
direction to the beach. Once you have experience the beach you'll see
clearly the signposts as a pointer to where you are going - not the
destination.&nbsp; </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">Again John makes his purpose clear
from the beginning and he does this in a most modern way: John, before
starting the detailed account of Jesus public ministry, presents us
with a management summary. He does this by showing the first three days
before Jesus goes public as a summary fulfilment of God's plan for
humanity. John has Jesus as the glorious completion of the Father
purpose pointed to by each of the feasts making-up the sacred Jewish
calendar. Jesus is the final word and glorious light in the time and
space of the chosen people. Time events, including both the feasts that
mark the sacred year and the Sabbath that marks the sacred week, will
receive the Word and the Light of the throne-room. This will cause the
shadow of these signposts to be overcome by the light of their complete
meaning presented in Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jesus enters into sacred time</strong><br />





        The 3 days<br />





        1st day - the lamb of God - the feast of Passover.<br />





        2nd day - the day of the Spirit - the feast of Weeks or Pentecost.<br />





        3rd day - the wedding feast of the bride and groom - the feast of tabernacles.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jesus creates space in our lives - sacred space&hellip;</strong> <br />




John in his gospel has Jesus starting his mission by going to the
temple and create sacred space for himself. By kicking over any
superficial understanding of God's dealings with man. All would be
replaced with the presence of God in our midst. This-world-temple is to
be replaced by the eternal temple: 'destroy this temple and in 3 days I
will rebuild it'. Jesus tells those who would challenge his authority
what will happen after the resurrection - he will rebuild the temple -
the eternal temple that is to be his bride. This post resurrection
temple is the eternal gathering where the great 'I am' is occupying the
sacred space that he has created for Himself.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">We are to no longer to look to this world's Jerusalem temple but to the New Jerusalem coming down from the throne room.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">John presents Jesus as entering the
world He created as if an artist entered his own art. "He was in the
world and the world came into being through him." Jn1: 10. He is both
the manifest presence of God as word and as light i.e. God's glory. Yet
this world is cannot contain the word or the light of god within its
bounds. The Word and the Light are at once in the world and beyond it.
Jesus knows where he has come from and where he is going. He is always
aware of this - he is of the throne-room and is going to it. This world
will not hold him. It can't. It is this eternal attribute, this oneness
with the Father who is at once beyond His creation and in it that will
be the reason cited for crucifying Jesus. We either worship the word
made flesh or we allow it no life in our lives. </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">Jesus hasn't come as word of the
father and as light of the Father's glory in indifference to our
response. Because this giving of the Son by the Father, is a giving
which is without measure, a giving of Godly love in all its force to
draw out a love response from us in return. This is not a selfish thing
on the side of God, but God knows that the best for us is to be found
in loving Him. It is this love relationship between God and us and us
and God that is eternal life for us. John would have us be children of
the word and of the light. He would have us know where we have come
from and where we are going. Like Jesus, John wants us to be empowered
by the knowledge that we are children born of the spirit, from our
father who is in heaven. And as a consequence we are to receive the
Word and the Light of Glory of Jesus as part of the very fabric of our
existence.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">So Jesus comes into our important
times and spaces and kicks over the tables that hold our formulaic
rituals we suppose can define the man-god relationship. God will not be
held within out understanding of him. He'll always smash-up what we are
content will keep our God at a safe distance: a distance where his word
and his glory will not require us to acknowledge their presence. Jesus
will not be contained within this thinking. He will not allow the place
of meeting between God and man to be robbed of living prayer, living
dynamic relationship where God's living and manifest word and light is
robbed of its divine effect. The Word from the throne-room - Jesus is
not a passive presence nor is the Light that shines from the
throne-room with the power of the glory of God the Father. The light of
Jesus is no passive light. It is a creative, living and demanding light
that shines as love stirring-up love from within us. For Jesus to be the
true Word and the Light that comes from the Father, Jesus in this
world will give us no peace.</p>
