      <p style="text-align: center;">(Read Luke 12:51 as a meditation)</p>


      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">'Nice' is one of those words I
dislike. I hate to be told I am nice. Some people might say 'nice'
meaning something truly nice but most use it to mean something nice and
agreeable, always compliant, never challenging or upsetting. I think of
a nice person as one who always gives you what you want, - a sort of
Santa figure. When it comes to Jesus - he was never nice. He was the
opposite of nice - He was loving. He never wanted to be misunderstood
as being a nice God for he knew that if we were allowed to think of him
as a nice God we would be well on our way to thinking of Jesus as some
sort of ATM machine God. Though too many of us, in our immature period,
think of Him in just that way. </p>





      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">We sometimes act as if we had God's
number; we go to our God outlet and access our ATM machine God with our
own personalised access code: P-r-a-y-e-r. We dial-up God with a prayer
and we expect a nice God at the other end of the line. This ATM God
will give us out what ever we want, whenever we want it, because this
is what we expect from a nice God. But Jesus is no Nice God. </p>





      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">I said the reason why so many of us
think this way is because we are immature, but this not the full
explanation. If this misunderstanding of God is simply a phase we go
through then you would expect more Christians to grow out of this
immature understanding. But too many don't. Part of the reason why they
don't grow-up is because some Pastors who don't want their people to
think of God in any other way are deliberately stunting their growth.
They preach messages about giving to God X Euro and getting back more
than you gave arguing that you can't out give God. And loads of similar
junk food is feed to these immature spiritual children by abusive
pastoral parents. In many ways these exploitative leaders and the
acquiescent children reflected what is going on in wider society. More
and more families in the west are made up of parent who can't say a
loving 'no' to their kids and kids who demand to be fed on physical,
moral and emotional junk.&nbsp; We give our children what they want
rather than what their need in exchange for peace and an easy life. The
irony is of course there is no real peace either for the parents of the
kids in these families, just over fed kids imprisoned by selfish and
unloving parents in a dynamic that will keep the kids immature and
dependant.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">These parents could never accept
that they are anything other than good parents who love their kids
dearly. In the end this may be their only excuse. But what excuse do
the pastoral parents have when they stand before their God to give
account when their defence will be - it made good business sense to
have them ignorant of any other aspect of God other than you as an ATM
machine God. </p>





      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">They may reason with God that if
makes good sense when building a church to have everyone work toward a
common easily understood vision. That vision or image is of a God that
can be controlled, shaped and presented as a nice God. This avoids the
messiness of learning to be with a God as teacher, leader, parent or
lover. </p>





      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">One of the reasons why Jesus came as
a man and lived among us publicly and privately is to show us he was no
nice ATM God. He was a real flesh and blood God: a God who wasn't
controlled by our constructs of him. He came as parent who knew what
was best for his children. He came as a teacher who corrected us when
we got it wrong and he wanted us to be knowledgeable about another
kingdom and its dynamic: a kingdom hidden since the foundation of the
world. He came as a leader to lead by first going in front of us into
the desert, and on to spending time and effort praying for and healing
the poor, and ultimately leading us through death. As a leader he asks
of those who would follow him to do no more than what he has already
done. As a lover he calls us friends; friends that want to be in each
other's company. He will not allow his relationship of love with us to
be debased by our ignorance, nor will he be acquiescent in our attempts
to reshape him into a nice god. </p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">This ATM image of God is not a new
creation of our ignorance. It is the construct of the perennial pagan:
one who constructs an image of God from his own understanding. It is a
vain activity, an activity whose origin is under the sun. God of
creation is bigger than what can be dreamt of in our philosophy.
Thought we might like to have a nice god, Jesus makes it clear that he
is not that god. He is no nice god, reducible to an ATM machine image.
In Luke's telling of the Jesus story we are left in no doubt - "<em>Do
you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you,
but rather division. From now on 5 will be divided: 3 against 2 and 2
against 3."</em> Lk 12:51&hellip;</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">No ATM God would say such a thing.
No ATM machine God could explain saying such a thing. One could only
hope for an explanation of such a remark from a great teacher who is a
loving parent trying to mature the ones he loves, leading them from
ignorance to knowledge of another kingdom. </p>





      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">Jesus is this God or as CS Lewis put
it - Jesus leaves you with 2 choices either Jesus is mad or he is God.
But one thing is for sure - he is no nice ATM God.</p>
