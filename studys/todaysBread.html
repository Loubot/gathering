      <p><strong>Today's Bread today&hellip;</strong><br />



      </p>



      
      
      
      <div style="text-align: left;">Manna was the frost like dew that
the people on their pilgrimage from Egypt to Israel ate in the
wilderness. They went out each day to gather up this manna with the
instruction that it was to be eaten on the same day that it was
collected. They were then to go looking for fresh manna the following
day. They were not permitted to eat day old manna. This was the point
of the story and its relevance to our pilgrim journey &ndash; we also
need daily bread. </div>



      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">When the disciples came to their
teacher and asked for instruction on how to pray on their journey,
Jesus taught them a prayer that included praying for daily bread - "<em>give us this day our daily bread.</em>"
Each day they were to pray for fresh bread. Yesterday's delivery could
not replace the need for today's delivery. The implications for us all
if obvious but no less challenging for that, we are to go out each day
and search afresh for new vibrant encounters with god. The old, though
of abiding worth, will not replace the need for us to seek afresh the
kingdom of God and its nourishment for our daily spiritual lives. </p>



      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">Paul in Ephesians tells us that
Jesus accented to heaven and sent gift back to us. These gifts were to
nourish us in our everyday. The gifts he sent down to us were varied,
different. They were to be distributed by each person by giving of
themselves to the wider community. In this way the community and each
member of it were to grow into maturity. But this wasn't simply an
extension of a social ethos of Paul's, encouraging gifted individuals
to have a social consciousness exercised for the common good. Paul was
no social worker. He was an apostle. Paul described an apostle as one -
sent from God while standing in his presence. This understanding of the
apostolic drove Paul's work as an apostle. It was work empowered from
another place - the throne-room. So, he exhorts those he was writing
to, not to live like those around them who where not driven by the same
understanding and therefore coming from a different place than Paul.
What disqualified these people from Paul's perspective was their
perspective. As a consequence of this worldly perspective they had
their heart hardened and where not sensitive to the things of the
spirit. </p>



      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">There is clear resonance here
between Paul's letter to the Ephesians and the letter to the Hebrews
where the writer to the Hebrews tells his readers not to harden their
hearts when they hear the voice of the Lord instructing them. "<em>Today, when you hear the voice of the Lord do not harden your hearts as in the day of rebellion</em>". The key word here is - "<strong><em>today"</em></strong>.
This day is the day of our daily bread. When we receive the living word
of God which Jesus called the bread of life we are in danger. We are in
danger in the same way as other pilgrim travellers who went before us,
the danger of not taking our daily bread on the day it is given. Our
inclination is to store-up what the Lord is saying for a later time. A
time we think might be more convenient. We kid ourselves with great
plans to put our lives in order and once we have done that we'll get
around to eating the heavenly bread. This is spiritual death. When we
hear from God either in our pray live our in our community life we are
to be with that word in that space and time. We are not to rearrange
our circumstances like some cosmic manager, but are to be as people led
by a teacher whose spiritual delivery we can trust in. Today when you
hear his voice don't do what the gentiles do - harden your heart, but
remain sensitive, and most of all pliable, to the word's instruction.
This is to live in the strength and the nourishment daily delivered
bread brings.</p>



      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">In a lot of cases "today" means with
in the 24 hours period. And for all of us this is our challenge - to
respond to the word given with in this time frame. But it would be
wrong to reduce this admonishment to a literal 24 hours whichever your
view of the creation story may be. Of course the lord can be speaking
to us over a long period of time and wants us to engage with a given
situation only after you have firstly though and prayed long and hard
about it. Literal 24 hours is not the issue. Rather the point at
question is that you are looking for fresh bread each day, not replying
on what you received days, weeks, months, and in a lot of cases what we
have received years ago. It is not so much about instruction from a
cosmic director as an on-going and vibrant relationship. Are you eating
what the Lord has provided for you in your desert or are you trying to
change your desert into something else before you expect to hear from
the Lord? This is the mistake of the immature. We want to change our
circumstances and then and only then deal with the Lord. Don't do that.
Let the fresh bread left on the surface of your desert circumstance be
your daily bread. This is where those who went before us found their
daily bread or manna - they found on the surface of the desert. Let's
look our daily bread in our deserts and let it empower us to transform
this world into the kingdom of Heaven.</p>
