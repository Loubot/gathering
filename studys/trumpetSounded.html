      <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">(Read Mark Chapter 14 verses 12 to 16, as a meditation)</span></strong></p>

      
      <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The tension between the contemplative and active Christian life&hellip;</strong><br />




The trumpet sounded two notes: "Go" and "Prepare". Jesus desire was to
have a meal with his friends. This was a most important meal, the last
one he would have and he wanted to share it with his friends. This meal
with his friends is the dramatisation of the Passover he is to fulfil
at a later point and on his own, before returning to his Father. But
before he has to depart he wants to share this meal with his friends.
They can do this much together. The cross will be the eternal
fulfilment of all Passover rites and only Jesus can fulfil and it must
be something he does on his own.&nbsp; </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">His friends ask where are they to make <em>preparations</em>
for his meal and in asking Jesus they have already entered the drama,
for Jesus tells them to "Listen". This is the deep "listening" of the
truly prayerful; this is the listening of the contemplative and the
fruit of this <em>Listen</em> is deep revelation: "when you enter the
city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the
house he enters and say to the owner of the house&hellip;". Everything
is as revealed from listening to Jesus. - The room is all furnished as
they were told it would be, for Jesus had organised everything? "So
they went and found everything as he had told them; and they <em>prepared</em> the Passover meal." </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">But why did they start to prepare
the meal? Had Jesus' power on earth reached its limit - he could
arrange for a furnished room but couldn't arrange for the meal itself
to be prepared, therefore he did what he could and then asked for the
help from his friends to prepare the meal for him? The room he was able
to prepare but the food he couldn't prepare? </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">Jesus is very clear when he says -
"make preparation for us there". Of course, he means for them to make
preparations 'there' i.e. in the furnished room, but he also means
more. He wants them to roll up their sleeves and get down and dirty in
the upper room, but he also means for them to realise that he wants
them to make preparations 'there' i.e. in the depths of revelation. </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">The two noted sounded are "Go" and
"Prepare". They come from the same trumpet, the one that John was to
later hear in the Throne room. These notes emanating from the throne
room are spoken forth with the same authority, because they come from
the same source, as the creation words hold all things together, so
these words from the same source have the same authority. These words
are the apostolic "Go" and the command to "prepare". </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">This is a further sharing in the
throne sending of Jesus where Jesus will do nothing except what he sees
his father, who is in heaven, doing first. Jesus "Goes" in the full
authority of the trinity and is to "prepare" a place: a sacred space
where he can be in the midst of his friends. Now he sends forth his
friends commissioned with the same words "Go and prepare".<br />




It would be much easier for them if they where to be given one note but
they are not they are given two. If it were only "go" they could simply
go as observers to the unfolding of the vision that was in the heart of
Jesus. It might then be like going to a movie and sitting with their
popcorn and coke watching the show, with a just a bit part to play
under the closest directions - "follow that man". But it is not like
that. Jesus doesn't want bit player he wants kings and priests in his
kingdom. So, the Trumpet has two notes "Go" and "Prepare". </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">Prepare is about organisation, it is
about planning, it is about rolling up your sleeves, it about getting
down and dirty: getting stuck in. In a word it is "incarnational". </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">"Those who are in right relationship
with me are those who hear my word and do them". It is both together
and in the same drama: listen hearing and doing. We can get any of it
wrong or right, but what we are not to do is say that one note from the
throne room is less than another. The apostolic "go" must be of no more
value to us than the imperative to "prepare". To be mature in the
spiritual world of Jesus we must be training to practice to hold these
two poles in tension. We are nor to resolve this tension in favour of
one side over another to suit our own disposition. We too, are to go
and prepare a space for Jesus, but first he has to go to the father to
prepare a space for us. It is a place he is preparing for us in the
throne room. </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">This is like the completion of a
circle: Jesus is send from the throne room in heaven to the pale shadow
of this heavenly space: the temple on earth. The first thing he does,
in John's account of his public ministry, is to clear the temple in
Jerusalem of clutter. He creates space for himself, for the Holy. An
echo chamber that will carry the resonance of the heavenly - Holy,
holy, holy. A space that has been robbed of prayer is to be restored
and added to by Jesus' presence. "Where two or three are gathered
together in my name there I am in their midst". </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">This is the Holy ground that Moses
is to walk in. The story goes something like this. Moses sees a bush
alight. He is told to take of his shoes because the ground is made holy
by the presence of god's glory. Moses asks the question - what do you
call yourself? And the answer is "I am the "I am" God: the living God. <br />




When Jesus talks about his church, his gathering (ecclesia the Greek
word for a gathering or Church) he says - &ldquo;Where two or three are
gathered together in my name there <em>I am</em> in their midst". It is the same "<em>I am"</em> that Moses comes into the presence of, at the bush. This same - <em>"I am"</em> is to fill the temple of Jesus with heavenly Glory. In the midst of those who gather in Jesus name is Holy ground.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">It is in this place of deep
revelation that Jesus intends to share a meal with us that we are to
learn to response to the call that has both "Go" and "Prepare"
contained in it. Firstly "Go" and be in this place as living stones and
also roll up your sleeves and busy yourselves with the work of
preparation.</p>
