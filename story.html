      <p align="center">A story of the Eagle and a bird</p>



      
      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">In a deep dark forest an ancient
people with strange customs lived. There was a river running through
their part of the forest and when their children reached a certain age
they were separated by gender with the boys going to one side of the
river and the girls going to the other. </p>


      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">On the side that was for the boys
the men gather together at night around the communal fire and told
stories and smoked their pipes. Each family had its own special blend
of tobacco, which has kept within the family. They also had a second
blend that each family was happy to share with their neighbours. The
custom of sharing pipers within the family and presenting a different
blend to those out-side the family was a well-established tradition. No
one quite knew where it came from. The stories they told were, all in
all, much the same between the families though there was about 100
different ones. The stories were all held in common more or less. The
most common, though least understood story, was a strange story of a
Great eagle that once flew the land, fought and overcame the great
dragon, before this great bird was finally killed trying to save his
friends. There was a lot more to the story but that seemed to be the
general thread to it. </p>


      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">On the side of the river that was
for the girls much the same thing happened, but in a much different
way. Again the women gathered around their fire and told stories - the
same ones that the lads told but from a different perspective. I
neglected to mention that on the men's side they told other stories
just like the women of the day's work and of their daily struggles
keeping the forest back and their clearing clear. Instead of smoking a
special blend of tobacco the women made traditional dresses. The
intricate stitches used were kept within each family and passed on from
generation to generation. </p>


      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">When a young couple start to be
aware of each other and decided that they wanted to be together. The
community as a whole - that's both the men and the women come together
to build the couple a raft. They sang - "We all want to give them the
best start in life possible" as a work shanty song to help them work
together while they built the raft.</p>


      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">When the time came for the young
couple to come together for their first night there is a great
celebration. And as they leave for the raft each of the parents give a
parting gift: the boys get the special blend of tobacco and its secret
and the girls get the traditional dresses and the secret of the special
family stitch. Their parents assure them that these generational gifts
will be a great comfort to them when the going gets tough. </p>


      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">Most of the young couples setting
out on life were so in love that they usually didn't open their family
gifts for a goodly length of time. As they moved down the river, going
in the most part with the flow, they started to notice campfires doted
along either side of the river. They always appeared in twos - one on
the left and one on the right sides of the river. It reminded them of
home and they felt a strange tug from these fires though they didn't
speak of it, the tug for the young husband was for the fires on the
right and for the wife it was the fires on the left. But as long as
they didn't open their special family gifts they would freely kept
moving along - further and further down the river. They, from time to
time, remembered and told each other the stories they grew up with
around their fires back home. They noticed that though their stories
were different they were the same in many ways. But the story that had
the greatest draw on them and seemed to flow with the river was an
older story - the story of the great eagle. The reasoned why this story
grew in importance for them is that they started to remember an
important part of the story that they had until that point in their
journey forgotten. They remembered that in the story the great eagle
spoke of a journey like their one with a broad lake at the end of it.
And as they moved on in harmony with the river's music a hope of
leaving the river and joining a great broad lake began to grow in them
also. They started to hope that they might be able to start a new life
of their own by travelling to this lake and living not separate lives
at their own campfires but together on this lake&rsquo;s shore. </p>


      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">Then the ruff water came. They knew
it would, as that was a part of all the stories they were told at home.
At the start they were determined that they would just keep going
listening not so much to the mad rush of the ruff surface water, but
rather to the deeper note below. After each hard day they were able to
find calm water to stop for the night. This calm water was well lit
from the many campfires on either shore. After a number of nights in
these calm places it slowly became apparent to them that this is where
most couples ended their journeys and left the river.&nbsp; </p>


      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">They determined to continue on,
despite the growing sense of fear they were each experiencing. As a way
of their coping they each would take out their comforter but without
the other noticing. The husband started to mix his special blend of
tobacco and she would admire the fine stitching on her now prized
procession. They kept travelling on though the tug of the communal
campfires was growing in each of them, yet they still had the hope of
coming to a broad lake were they could be free of the river and the tug
of the campfires. Imagine their horror at the end of this day to see
the forest on either side of the river close in to meet in the middle.
In fear they stopped. They weighted anchor in mid-river. </p>


      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">As the days and the years went by,
they found themselves visiting the inviting fires on either side of the
river. Each night they sat around the fires with their special tobacco
and traditional dress, he on his side and she on hers. They hadn't
quite grown apart yet though they were slowly becoming like their
parents they left behind and the ancient people of old: her with her
dress and special stitching made her welcome at the women's campfire
and he with his special blend of tobacco at the men's. They missed
their life on the raft and their shared hopes so they always tried to
get back to sleep on their raft each night. They lay quietly side by
side, anchored and trapped in their fear and by the pull of old life.
Yet they were not just ready to give up on their hopes and dreams. And
when they retold the story of the eagle this seemed to help in some way.</p>


      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">One morning the sun rose brightly.
And in a bird flew directly to them. Strangely this happened as they
had been retelling the eagle story again. And at first they thought it
was the eagle coming to encourage them or better to tell them the way
to the lake. As it settled on the front of the raft it sang an ancient
bird-song re-telling the story of an eagle that had flown through the
darkest darkness to the broad-shored lake. The dove stopped its song
for just long enough to say, "come follow me". They started to tell
this little bird why it was no longer possible to travel on - they told
how they had lost their youthful fire; and that they were becoming more
and more like the ancients on the banks of the river. But most of all
they spoke of not being able to see away forward through the forest
that was blocking their way. But all that the dove said in its soft
still voice was "come follow me". They reasoned - this was no mighty
eagle but a little gentle dove. Who would follow a gentle dove?</p>
