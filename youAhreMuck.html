      <p> -"&hellip;<em>then the Lord God formed man from the dust of
the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the
man became a living being."</em> Gen.2:7.</p>


      
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">I was preparing a teaching for a
Church group in Scotland. I was told by the leader that I should keep
it simple. A simple message - they would take in, if I did anything
more than that I wouldn't keep their attention.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

That made it easy - I decided to take out one of my older teachings and
dust it off for them. But as I prayed about which one to choose I read
this verse - "&hellip;<em>then
the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into
his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being."</em> </p>

      
      <p style="text-align: left;">It is part of the creation story.
What struck me for the first time was a question - why did God use dirt
to create? He was able to made the sun, moon and stars out of nothing
continuing in this vain for 7 days and then to have to revert to using
dirt or muck to form man seemed a strange and a diversion to his well
established way of going - creating everything from nothing.</p>

      
      <p style="text-align: left;">God could have used <em>nothing</em>
to create man too, but he didn't. He hadn't got tired after 6 days of
creating and now had to revert to the help of the material world to
form his final being. Nor, was he board and wanted to try something
new. But he was showing at the very start of things the way he would
re-create the new man when the time was right. </p>

      
      <p style="text-align: left;">I remembered the story told by the
prophet Jeremiah. Jeremiah tells of going down to the potter's shed and
seeing a piece of clay on a potter's wheel. The first turning of the
clay produces a flawed vessel. The potter starts again with the same
piece of clay and produces another vessel - A second creation from the
same clay. That is the way that the Good Lord works with us. He doesn't
rub us out to start anew. </p>

      
      <p style="text-align: left;">As I started to teach this to our
friends in Scotland, I asked how many of us would like the Lord to just
rub out all our past life and create from nothing a perfect person.
Most of the people there thought this would be something they would
like. But that is not what the Lord will do with us. He will not rub us
out and start anew, creating our new lives from nothing, wiping out our
past lives, our experiencing and relationships, our connections to the
place and people we live with. It is the dirt of our lives to date that
the Lord God uses to create the new man.</p>

      
      <p style="text-align: left;">It is easy for us to sometimes forget that '<em>God so loved us, while we were yet sinners that he gave his only begotten Son'</em>.
We think that God loved us when we were all cleaned up and put right,
when we became a new creation. But that is not so. He loved us when we
were yet sinners. He loves us as we are, but he loves us too much to
leave us as we are. In so doing he doesn't throw away the old muck that
was our lives but uses it as the raw material to be formed into the new
creation. So he creates the new man in us from what he holds precious -
us.</p>

      
      <p style="text-align: left;">The prophet Isaiah tells us that God
has our name written in the palm of his hands. This is the new name
that is spoken about by John in his book of revelations. This name is
no tag to label us with; rather, it is our new identity in Christ. This
name is the summation of God creative work where he names us as a
creation in His own image. </p>

      
      <p style="text-align: left;">Back to the potter in the shed - God
is compared to the potter re-forming the vessel. When the potter has
the vessel formed he will lift it in his hands and turn and place it in
the kiln to be fired. But in the moment of turning the name, embossed
in the palm of his hands - his new name for us, is impressed in to the
clay thus naming it. Not by way of tagging it, but by way of calling
forth the new image in Christ that God the creator has for us. </p>

      
      <p style="text-align: left;">The point that I wanted to make to
these precious people in Scotland is that all of their lives and
experiences are precious to God and he wants to place his breath in the
clay of their lives. So that they can be men and women as God intends
the fullness of his creation formed from the clay of their lives,
relationships, and place.</p>
